        <p>Divorce in Flanders is an interacademic (UA, KUL, VUB, UGent, SVR) research project, financed by FWO-SBO. The project aims to get insight in the causes and consequences of family dissolution. Therefore, we compare ever-divorced people with those who are still in their first marriage. Divorce and separation are multi-facet life-events, involving different actors (partners, parents, children, care providers, lawyers,...), and affecting many aspects of life. The data for the project is collected in a multi-actor perspective giving information on both spouses, a child and the parents of both spouses, resulting in a high-standard large-scale database. The study focuses on the following topics: demographic characteristics, partnership, parenthood, social networks, socio-economic factors, well-being, service use, divorce processes and cultural orientations.</p>
